• The executable must be named Grace.
• When executed, the program writes in a file named Grace_kid.s the source code of the file used to compile the program.

• The Assembly source code must strictly contain:
	◦ No extra routines beyond the entry point needed to perform the task (no additional procedures).
	◦ Exactly three macros (or the closest equivalent for your assembler).
	◦ One comment.
